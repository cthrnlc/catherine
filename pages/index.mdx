# Catherine Campbell

I am an M.A. in Peace and Social Transformation student at the Earlham School of Religion, the Quaker seminary in Richmond, IN. Before coming to ESR, I studied the history of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.

I am a member of the Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia, which meets in a beautiful 215-year-old meetinghouse in the Old City neighborhood, and these days on Zoom. I also serve as a co-clerk for the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting Young Adult Friends, and on the pastoral care committee for our community. I am the proud big sister of [@lachlanjc](https://lachlanjc.com) and an aspiring future health care chaplain.
